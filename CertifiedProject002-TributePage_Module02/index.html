            <h3>Brendan Eich and Early life</h3>
            <p>Brendan Eich (born July 4, 1961)is an American computer programmer and technology executive. He created the JavaScript programming language and co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation. He served as the Mozilla Corporation's chief technical officer before he was appointed chief executive officer, but resigned shortly after his appointment due to pressure over his firm opposition to same-sex marriage. He subsequently became the CEO of Brave Software.</p>        
            <p>Eich grew up in Pittsburgh; Gaithersburg, Maryland; and Palo Alto, where he attended Ellwood P. Cubberley High School, graduating in the class of 1979. He received his bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science at Santa Clara University, and he received his master's degree in 1985 from the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign. Eich is Roman Catholic.</p>
            <p>He began his career at Silicon Graphics, working for seven years on operating system and network code.</p>
            <p>He then worked for three years at MicroUnity Systems Engineering writing microkernel and DSP code.</p>

            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>Eich began his career at Silicon Graphics, working for seven years on operating systems and networking systems. He then worked for three years at MicroUnity Systems Engineering writing microkernels and code for DSPs, coming up with the first port of the GCC compiler to MIPS R4000.</p>
            <p>Eich is best known for his work at Netscape and Mozilla. He began working at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995, working on JavaScript (originally called Mocha, later LiveScript) for the Netscape Navigator web browser.</p>                            
            <p>He then helped found mozilla.org in 1998, serving as chief architect. When AOL shut down the division for the Netscape browser in July 2003, Eich helped start the Mozilla Foundation.</p>                
            <p>In August 2005, after serving as a technology leader and member of the board of directors of the Mozilla Foundation, Eich became CTO of the newly founded Mozilla Corporation.</p>                
            <p>In May 2015, in partnership with Brian Bondy, they founded Brave Software, the company responsible for developing the Brave browser.</p>

            <h3>Brave Software</h3>
            <p>Eich is the co-founder and CEO of Brave Software, an Internet browser platform company that raised $2.5 million in early funding from angel investors like Founders Fund, Foundation Capital, and Digital Currency Group. In January 2016, the company released developer versions of its open-source, Chromium-based and privacy-focused Brave web browser, which blocks ads and trackers, and features built-in Tor-connected tabs.</p>
            <p>At Brave Software, Eich co-created the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a cryptocurrency designed for use in the Brave browser. BAT launched its ICO on May 31, 2017, and raised $35 million.</p>                
            <p>In 2020, the New York Times reported that Eich's comments about "the policy and science related to the coronavirus" on Twitter caused a backlash within the browser's userbase, commenting that this echoed the criticism that led to his resignation from Mozilla.</p>
